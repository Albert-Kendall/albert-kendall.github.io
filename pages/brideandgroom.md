## About Albert and Kendall

**Albert**

Albert was born on October 26, 1981 in Chester, IL. He then grew up in a small town in Southern Illinois. After he finished high school, he went on to college at John A. Logan College to pursue a degree in Management Information Systems. After receiving his Associates degree, he took a semester off to intern at the Walt Disney World College Program (where he met Kendall!). He then returned back to Illinois finish his degree at Southern Illinois University - Carbondale. During that time (and several long distance phone calls to Kendall), he asked Kendall to be his girlfriend. Five months later he moved to Orlando and began his IT company, and life with Kendall.

**Kendall**

Kendall was born on March 16th, 1982 in Daytona Beach Florida. She lived in Ormond Beach for three years until her family moved to a house in Orlando. She grew up there and was homeschooled until she graduated high school. Her main hobby was dance, and she continued dancing while she attended Valencia Community College and worked part time at Barnies Coffee and Tea, and part time at the Disney MGM Studios. That part is obviously important because that is where she met Albert! She went on to Major in Choreography and Modern Dance at the University of Florida in Gainesville until graduating in December 2004. After graduating she moved back to Orlando to be with her family, and Albert also moved to Orlando. Now, as a dance teacher and certified Pilates instructor, Kendall can't wait to marry Albert and live happily every after!
